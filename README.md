## Install
To install the library, download it to your local computer. After that, use a tool such as [adafruit-ampy](https://github.com/scientifichackers/ampy) or [pyboard.py](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/tools/pyboard.py) to load it onto your MicroPython board.

You should install it into a `/lib` folder on your board to differentiate it from your project files.
